Technical Architecture Decisions
Why Persona-Based Scoring?
Different data center types have fundamentally different infrastructure requirements:

Hyperscalers need massive power capacity and reliability above all
Colocation providers balance power, connectivity, and operational efficiency
Edge computing prioritizes quick deployment and low latency over capacity

Generic renewable energy scoring doesn't capture these nuanced requirements.
Why 1.0-10.0 Display Scale?

User-friendly: Intuitive rating system (like IMDb, Yelp)
Precise: 0.1 increments allow nuanced differentiation
Professional: Investment-grade appearance vs. academic letter grades
Scalable: Easy to extend with additional personas or criteria

Why TNUoS Integration?
Transmission costs can vary by £800k+ annually between regions for large projects. This represents a major operational cost difference that significantly impacts investment viability, especially for hyperscale deployments.
Why Streamlined Dashboard Design?
The original tabbed navigation spread functionality too thin. The new Power Developer Dashboard design prioritizes:

Single-screen workflows: Everything visible without tab switching
Optimized information hierarchy: Most important data prominently displayed
Reduced cognitive load: Fewer decisions, clearer paths to insights
Mobile responsiveness: Works across all device sizes

Development Team Requirements
Immediate Priorities (Next 2-4 Weeks)

Backend Developer: Fix development stage scoring and enhance algorithm generosity
Full-Stack Developer: Complete TNUoS algorithm integration
Frontend Developer: Apply streamlined design patterns to Data Center Developer Dashboard
QA Engineer: Test enhanced scoring algorithms for business logic accuracy

Medium Term (1-3 Months)

Data Engineer: Optimize spatial queries and infrastructure data pipeline
UX Designer: Design advanced filtering and comparison tools
AI Engineer: Complete Supabase Edge Functions deployment for persona analysis
DevOps Engineer: Implement automated data refresh pipelines

    stage_score * weights["development_stage"] +
    tech_score * weights["technology"] +
    grid_score * weights["grid_infrastructure"] +
    digital_score * weights["digital_infrastructure"] +
    water_score * weights["water_resources"] +
    lcoe_score * weights["lcoe_resource_quality"] +
    tnuos_score * weights.get("tnuos_transmission_costs", 0)
)
```

### API Workflow
```
Frontend Persona Selection → Weight Normalization → Batch Rescoring → Map Visualization
```

### Current Persona Weights
```python
PERSONA_WEIGHTS = {
    "hyperscaler": {
        "capacity": 0.25, "development_stage": 0.20, "technology": 0.08,
        "grid_infrastructure": 0.17, "digital_infrastructure": 0.05,
        "water_resources": 0.05, "tnuos_transmission_costs": 0.12,
        "lcoe_resource_quality": 0.08
    },
    "colocation": {
        "capacity": 0.13, "development_stage": 0.18, "technology": 0.08,
        "grid_infrastructure": 0.22, "digital_infrastructure": 0.22,
        "water_resources": 0.05, "tnuos_transmission_costs": 0.10,
        "lcoe_resource_quality": 0.02
    },
    "edge_computing": {
        "capacity": 0.09, "development_stage": 0.26, "technology": 0.14,
        "grid_infrastructure": 0.14, "digital_infrastructure": 0.23,
        "water_resources": 0.05, "tnuos_transmission_costs": 0.06,
        "lcoe_resource_quality": 0.03
    }
}
```

Half-Distance Calibrated Proximity Scoring - Replaced arbitrary exponential decay with intuitive calibration (30km substations, 30km transmission, 10km fiber, 60km IXP, 25km water)
Exponential LCOE Decay - Implemented proper exponential penalty system with £55/MWh baseline and 0.04 gamma slope, replacing flat scoring
TNUoS Percentile Ranking - Added latitude-based TNUoS estimation with percentile scoring across UK's -3 to +16 £/kW range
Capacity Gating - Implemented DC demand filtering (≥1MW edge, ≥5MW colocation, ≥50MW hyperscaler) with 90% adequacy threshold
Rebalanced Persona Weights - Reduced grid infrastructure weights to prevent overweighting, increased LCOE importance

Frontend Integration (PersonaSelector.tsx, HyperscalerDashboard.tsx)

8-Component System - Extended PersonaSelector to handle TNUoS transmission costs component
Weight Normalization - Fixed persona weight totals to sum to 100%
Capacity Display Updates - Changed capacity badges from ranges to minimum thresholds (≥1MW, ≥5MW, ≥50MW)
