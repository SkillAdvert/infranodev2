## Data Fetching & Integration

### Current Data Pipeline
1. **fetch_gsp_boundaries.py**: NESO official GSP data (333 polygons)
2. **fetch_fiber_data.py**: Telecommunications infrastructure via Overpass API  
3. **fetch_network.py**: Additional network infrastructure aggregation
4. **main.py**: Centralized API serving with batch optimization

### Infrastructure Data Status
- **Working**: GSP boundaries, fiber networks, substations, IXPs
- **Issues**: Transmission lines endpoint timeouts (500 status codes)
- **Performance**: 17+ seconds full dataset load, optimized with batch processing

### Deployment Workflow  
**Current Process:**
1. Run data fetching scripts locally against production Supabase
2. Deploy clean main.py (without admin endpoints) to Render
3. Frontend connects to production API endpoints

**Rationale:** Local data fetching avoids Render execution environment limitations and timeout issues

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Why Persona-Based Scoring?
Different data center types have fundamentally different infrastructure requirements:
- **Hyperscalers** need massive power capacity and reliability above all
- **Colocation providers** balance power, connectivity, and operational efficiency
- **Edge computing** prioritizes quick deployment and low latency over capacity

Generic renewable energy scoring doesn't capture these nuanced requirements.

### Why 1.0-10.0 Display Scale?
- **User-friendly**: Intuitive rating system (like IMDb, Yelp)
- **Precise**: 0.1 increments allow nuanced differentiation
- **Professional**: Investment-grade appearance vs. academic letter grades
- **Scalable**: Easy to extend with additional personas or criteria

### Why AI Integration?
Persona-based scoring provides quantitative analysis, but investors need qualitative insights:
- **Contextual Analysis**: AI explains why a site scores well/poorly for specific personas
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies concerns human analysts might miss
- **Opportunity Identification**: Suggests optimization strategies
- **Comparative Intelligence**: Explains trade-offs between persona approaches

### Why Batch Processing Infrastructure Queries
Individual proximity calculations were taking 30+ seconds per site. Batch processing loads all infrastructure once and processes multiple sites against cached data, achieving 10-50x performance improvements.

### Why UK Geographic Bounds Only
Initial market focus enables deeper infrastructure data integration and regulatory understanding. Expansion to other regions requires similar infrastructure dataset development and local market knowledge.

### Why No Browser Storage APIs  
Claude.ai artifact environment limitations prevent localStorage/sessionStorage usage. All state management uses React hooks with session-based persistence.

### Why Exponential Distance Scoring
Linear distance scoring doesn't reflect the dramatic cost differences between nearby vs. distant infrastructure. Exponential decay better models real-world infrastructure connection costs and development feasibility.

### 📋 Next Steps (Immediate Priority)

#### Phase 1: Algorithm Enhancement (Next 1-2 weeks)
1. **Add TNUoS Component Scoring Function**:
   ```python
   def calculate_tnuos_cost_score(project_lat, project_lng, capacity_mw) -> float:
       # Spatial query to find TNUoS zone
       # Calculate annual cost impact
       # Convert to 10-100 scoring scale
   ```

2. **Update Persona Weightings**: Implement Algorithm 2.2 with TNUoS weights

3. **Integrate Spatial Queries**: 
   - PostGIS ST_Within() queries to match projects to TNUoS zones
   - Batch processing for performance optimization

#### Phase 2: Frontend Enhancement (Next 2-3 weeks)
1. **Component Breakdown Updates**:
   - Add "Transmission Costs" to scoring displays
   - Show annual cost impact in project popups: "Est. Annual TNUoS: £X,XXX"
   - **Note**: TNUoS zones remain as background visualization only (no clickable popups)

2. **Dashboard Integration**:
   - Enhanced filtering by TNUoS cost ranges
   - Comparative analysis showing cost impact across personas
   - Economic impact summaries in AI insights

3. **Unit Standardization**: 
   - Display all TNUoS rates as "£/kW" (not "£/kW/year" for clarity)
   - Consistent economic impact formatting throughout UI

#### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Next 4-6 weeks)
1. **Multi-Year Projections**: Historical TNUoS trends and forecasting
2. **Economic Modeling**: Full lifecycle cost analysis with TNUoS integration
3. **Comparative Regional Analysis**: Cost optimization recommendations
4. **AI-Enhanced Insights**: TNUoS-aware investment recommendations

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Queries Required
```sql
-- Spatial join to determine project TNUoS zones
SELECT p.*, tz.generation_tariff_pounds_per_kw, tz.zone_id
FROM renewable_projects p
JOIN tnuos_zones tz ON ST_Within(
    ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(p.longitude, p.latitude), 4326),
    tz.geometry
);
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Spatial Indexing**: Ensure tnuos_zones.geometry has GiST index
- **Batch Processing**: Extend existing batch proximity calculation for TNUoS
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache zone lookups for frequently queried projects

### Data Quality Assurance
- **Validation**: All 27 TNUoS zones have valid tariff data
- **Coverage**: Verify all UK projects fall within zone boundaries
- **Currency**: Annual tariff updates (typically April each year)

## Frontend Component Updates

### DynamicSiteMap.tsx ✅ Complete
- TNUoS zones display as colored polygons
- Color coding: Green (negative tariffs) → Red (high positive tariffs)
- Infrastructure toggle in all dashboard pages
- **Design Decision**: Zones are background visualization only, no clickable popups

### Dashboard Pages ✅ Complete
- **HyperscalerDashboard.tsx**: TNUoS toggle added to infrastructure layers
- **UtilityDashboard.tsx**: TNUoS toggle added to infrastructure layers  
- **SiteMappingTools.tsx**: Already working via DynamicSiteMap internal state

### Pending Frontend Updates

2. **Component Scoring Displays**: Include transmission costs breakdown
3. **Filter Controls**: TNUoS cost range filtering
4. **Economic Impact Cards**: Annual cost summaries per persona

## Business Impact Analysis

### Before TNUoS Integration
Investment scoring focused on technical feasibility and basic infrastructure proximity without considering operational transmission costs.

### After TNUoS Integration
Investment decisions now incorporate:
- **Real Operational Costs**: £766k/year difference between regions for 50MW projects
- **Persona-Specific Impact**: Hyperscalers weight transmission costs heavily (15%), edge computing less so (7%)
- **Economic Optimization**: Sites in South England score higher due to negative transmission charges
- **Regional Strategy**: Clear economic incentives for southern vs northern development

### Expected Scoring Changes
- **North Scotland Projects**: Expect 0.5-1.5 point decreases in investment ratings
- **South England Projects**: Expect 0.3-0.8 point increases in investment ratings  
- **Persona Differentiation**: Hyperscaler ratings more sensitive to TNUoS than edge computing ratings

## Quality Assurance & Testing

### Algorithm Testing Required
1. **Scoring Validation**: Verify expensive zones score lower, cheap zones score higher
2. **Persona Sensitivity**: Confirm hyperscalers react more strongly to TNUoS costs than edge computing
3. **Economic Accuracy**: Validate annual cost calculations match National Grid tariffs
4. **Boundary Testing**: Ensure all UK projects correctly assigned to TNUoS zones

### Performance Testing
- **Spatial Query Performance**: <500ms for batch TNUoS zone lookups
- **API Response Time**: Enhanced endpoints maintain <2s response times
- **Map Rendering**: TNUoS polygon overlay doesn't impact map performance

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Spatial Query Performance**: Large polygon geometries may slow queries
  - *Mitigation*: Proper indexing and query optimization
- **Data Currency**: TNUoS rates change annually
  - *Mitigation*: Automated annual data refresh pipeline

### Business Risks  
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Adding 7th component increases scoring complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive testing and clear component explanations
- **User Confusion**: Economic vs technical scoring balance
  - *Mitigation*: Clear UI explanations of transmission cost impact

## Development Team Requirements

### Immediate (Next 2 weeks)
- **Backend Developer**: Implement spatial queries and Algorithm 2.2
- **Database Engineer**: Optimize spatial indexing and query performance
- **QA Engineer**: Test economic calculations and scoring accuracy

### Medium Term (Next 4-6 weeks)
- **Frontend Developer**: Enhanced UI components for TNUoS data display
